Author: This program was created by James C. Hernandez and represents original work. 
Any resemblance to other programs is purely coincidental.

Overview:
This program is a C# implementation of a standard deck of 52 playing cards. It has been designed to serve 
as a practice tool for hands-on programming scenarios, such as technical lab exercises during job interviews.

The primary functionality includes:
1) Generating a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
2) Shuffling the deck using a randomized algorithm.
3) Displaying the shuffled deck in its new order.

Purpose:
The program provides a streamlined solution to demonstrate essential programming skills, including 
object-oriented principles, algorithm design, and attention to detail. It's an excellent tool for 
honing problem-solving techniques while preparing for job interviews.

Features
1) Deck Creation: Generates a complete set of 52 cards, including all suits (hearts, diamonds, 
spades, clubs) and ranks (Ace through King).

2) Shuffle Functionality: Randomizes the order of the cards in the deck.

3) Display Results: Outputs the shuffled deck for inspection and validation.

How to Use
Compile and run the program in a C# development environment, such as Visual Studio.

The program automatically creates and shuffles the deck.

View the shuffled deck in the console output.
